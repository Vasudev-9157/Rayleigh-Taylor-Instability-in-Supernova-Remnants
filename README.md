# Rayleigh-Taylor-Instability-in-Supernova-Remnants
This project deals with a general MHD dispersion relation for the Rayleigh–Taylor instability in stellar interiors, it also predicts critical / fastest-growing wavelengths, and confirmed the theory with self-written 2D finite-volume simulations of magnetised flows.
